* Mono repository for all my smarthome needs.

In progress. Gathering and growing my smarthome tools.


** IO Controller MainBoard

- Cheap!
- Easy for DIY, even on a breadboard or soldered with wires.
- Uses available ready modules so there's not much to solder yourself.
- Assumes a distributed (using CAN), resiliant architecture.
- Based on STM32G431 WeAct module. Could be migrated to use other - eg. stm32f4.
- Has rudimentary (and optional) ESD protection using esda6v1s3.

** Greenfinger

Automatic plant watering using ESP8266 (or ESP32) using Micropython.
Integrates with HomeAssistant over MQTT:
- Reports status (humidity, operations).
- Can be controlled over MQTT (more water NOW).

It was 100% stable during a period of about a year. Plants died for unrelated
reasons. ;)
